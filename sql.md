### SQL Query Execution Order  

Understanding the order in which SQL statements are executed is critical for crafting accurate and efficient queries. Hereâ€™s the logical sequence in which SQL clauses are processed:  

1. **FROM** - Specifies the source tables for the query.  
2. **JOIN** - Combines data from multiple tables based on a condition.  
3. **WHERE** - Filters rows based on conditions before grouping.  
4. **GROUP BY** - Groups data for aggregation.  
5. **HAVING** - Filters groups based on aggregated data.  
6. **SELECT** - Chooses the columns or expressions to return in the result set.  
7. **OVER** - Applies window functions over partitions of data.  
8. **QUALIFY** - Filters rows based on window function results (used in some SQL dialects like Snowflake).  
9. **ORDER BY** - Sorts the result set by specified columns or expressions.  
10. **LIMIT** - Restricts the number of rows returned in the final output.
