# **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) in Data Science**

In data science, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are essential metrics that quantify an organization's progress toward its goals. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the most important KPIs across various domains, including Sales and Marketing, Customer Retention and Value, Operational Efficiency, Financial Health, and Customer Satisfaction and Engagement. Each KPI is clearly defined and includes formulas for accurate calculation. By understanding these KPIs, data scientists can drive informed decisions and improve business performance.

### **1. Customer Retention and Value KPIs**  
These KPIs assess how effectively a business retains and generates value from its customers over time. Retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making these metrics a top priority.

1. **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**  
   Provides a more aggregated view of the total revenue a business can expect from a customer over their entire relationship. LTV is often used for a broader, long-term perspective.

   $$\text{LTV} = \text{Average Purchase Value} \times \text{Purchase Frequency} \times \text{Customer Lifespan}$$

2. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**  
   A more granular metric that focuses on the long-term revenue potential of a customer, typically with a narrower scope such as a specific segment or time frame. CLV is used to track customer profitability in greater detail.

   $$\text{CLV} = \text{Average Revenue per User (ARPU)} \times \text{Customer Lifespan}$$

3. **Churn Rate**  
   Measures the percentage of customers who stop using a product or service during a specific period.

   $$\text{Churn Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Lost Customers}}{\text{Total Customers at Start of Period}} \times 100$$
