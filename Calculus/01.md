## Geometric Interpretation of Derivative

To find the tangent line to $y = f(x)$ at $P = (x_0, y_0)$, use the following equation:

$$y - y_0 = m (x - x_0)$$

Where:
- $y_0 = f(x_0)$  
- $m = f'(x_0)$

> $f'(x_0)$, the derivative of $f$ at $x_0$, represents the **slope of the tangent line** to $y = f(x)$ at $P$.  

The **tangent line** is the limit of the **secant line** $PQ$ as $Q \to P$ (keeping $P$ fixed).

$$f'(x) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x + \Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}$$
